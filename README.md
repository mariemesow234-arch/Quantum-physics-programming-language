# Quantum Physics Programming Language

## Philosophy
This project is not just code.  
It is an attempt to **bridge different worlds** – physics, mathematics, programming, and philosophy – and to uncover the **hidden links** that connect them.  
Each qubit, each function is a metaphor for how I think: seeing possibilities, connections, and collapses.

## Personal Impact
Working on this language changes me.  
It forces me to accept uncertainty, to live with multiple states at once, and to observe my own ideas as if they were qubits in superposition.  
This is both a technical and an inner journey.

## The Struggle
Nothing comes easy.  
Installing tools, understanding concepts, writing code that reflects quantum behavior… it is a daily struggle.  
But this struggle is proof of persistence: every error, every bug becomes an observation that **collapses** my ideas into greater clarity.

## Goal
To create a language that does not simply execute instructions, but **embodies quantum logic**.  
A language that inspires others to think in terms of potentiality, connections, and interactions beyond determinism.

## Minimal Example
```python
from main import Qubit, entangle, observe

q1 = Qubit([0,1])
q2 = Qubit([0,1])
entangle(q1, q2)
print(observe(q1))
