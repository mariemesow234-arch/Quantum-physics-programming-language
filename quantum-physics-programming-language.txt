QUANTUM PHYSICS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE - CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Superposition: Variables can exist in multiple states simultaneously
- Entanglement: Two linked variables - changing one instantly affects the other  
- Collapse: State resolves only upon observation

PROPOSED SYNTAX:
var qubit = [0,1]          // Superposition state
entangle(qubit, qubit2)    // Quantum entanglement
observe(qubit)             // Collapse to definite state

APPLICATIONS:
- Probabilistic algorithms with intrinsic uncertainty
- Natural modeling of real-world ambiguous systems
- Interactive systems evolving with user observation

INNOVATION:
This language doesn't just execute code - it mirrors quantum behavior, enabling programmers to think in terms of potentiality and interaction beyond deterministic steps.
